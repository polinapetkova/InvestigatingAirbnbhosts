# The effect of Airbnb host response time on bookings


## Good Host vs Bad Host: What makes an "attractive" Airbnb host?
Attractive host refers to the host that due to specific qualities, traits and other factors is more preferable than the other competitive AirBnb hosts.

## And why global?
__Simply because the world is more connected than ever before!__

Travelling has become a global trend and consequently travelers from Europe can now reach destinations in Asia and get to know the local culture, a couple from Latin America can safely book accommodation for their adventurous trip in the magical landscapes of Africa or a researcher from Australia can easily select a single room for his investigation journey to North America and the list is endless...

## Research Motivation
As a result of this global connectivity and increased travelling frequency the pioneering platform of AirBnB has been established as the leader in online lodging, primarily home stays for vacation rentals and tourism activities with more than 2.8 million hosts(2021). Nevertheless, increased offer comes with increased competition and the hosts need to find new ways of attracting the people.

By assessing whether the response time affect the number of bookings that the hosts have, we will provide useful insight and tips to AirBnB's hosts in order to improve their overall performance and service delivery.


__Why it matters?__
* Greater response time leads to higher chance to become a *Superhost* on the platform!
* By responding faster, hosts can remove customers' anxiety about the booking process! Some guests contact more than one listing owner at the same time and it is crutial to respond as quickly as possible!
* Delay replies might lead to lost revenue. 
* Response rate affect hosts' search placement. 

**Quicker response time is one of the most important elements of being a good hosts**


## Method and results
The method that was used to investigate whether there is a relationship between the host response time and the number of bookings of the host is **linear regression analysis**. Linear regression analysis is used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This research method will show whether there is a positive/negative effect of host response time on number of bookings or if there is no effect at all. 

### Summary of the results
